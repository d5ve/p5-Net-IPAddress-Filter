NAME
    Net::IPAddress::Filter - A compact and fast IP Address range filter

VERSION
    version 20121112

SYNOPSIS
        my $filter = Net::IPAddress::Filter->new();

        $filter->add_range('10.0.0.10', '10.0.0.50');
        $filter->add_range('192.168.1.1');

        print "In filter\n" if $filter->in_filter('10.0.0.25');

DESCRIPTION
    Net::IPAddress::Filter uses the XS module Set::IntervalTree under the
    hood. An Interval Tree is a data structure optimised for fast insertions
    and searches of ranges, so sequential scans are avoided. The XS tree
    data structure is more compact than a pure Perl version of the same.

    In initial testing on an AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 4200+,
    Net::IPAddress::Filter did about 60k range inserts/sec, and about 100k
    lookups per second. The process memory size grew by about 1MB per 7,500
    ranges inserted.

METHODS
  new ( )
    Constructs new blank filter object.

    Expects: None.

    Returns: Blessed filter object.

  add_range( )
    Expects: $start_ip - A dotted quad IP address string. $end_ip - An
    optional dotted quad IP address string. Defaults to $start_ip.

    Returns: None.

  in_filter( )
    Test whether a given IP address is in one of the ranges in the filter.

    Expects: $test_ip - A dotted quad IP address string.

    Returns: 1 if test IP is in one of the ranges. 0 otherwise.

FUNCTIONS
  _ip_address_to_number( )
    Utility function to convert a dotted quad IP address to a number.

    TODO: Handle IPv6 addresses as well.

    Expects: A dotted quad IP address string.

    Returns: The integer representation of the IP address.

TODO
    *   Support for IPv6 Addresses. This would need a lot of work, as

        Set::IntervalTree uses long ints internally, and IPv6 needs 128-bit
        numbers.
